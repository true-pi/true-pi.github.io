<p>It all begins well over 2000 years ago (if you can believe history textbooks) in ancient Greece, with a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a>.</p>

<p>He devised a geometrical method of finding approximate value of Pi, by calculating perimeters of regular n-sided polygons.</p>

<p>The idea was basically this:</p>

<ul>
<li>put one n-sided polygon that just fits inside the circle (inscribed polygon), and put another polygon that circumscribes the circle (fits around it).</li>
<li>The circumference of the circle will be somewhere between perimeter of inner and outer polygons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with two 6-sided regular polygons (hexagons), and doubling the number of sides in several steps, he reached two 96-sided regular polygons that more closely fit the curvature of the circle.</p>

<p>Result was a proud declaration that <strong>&ldquo;proved&rdquo;</strong> value of <strong>Pi</strong> to be:</p>

<p><sup>223</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub> &lt; <strong>Pi</strong> &lt; <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>     ( 3.14085 &lt; <strong>Pi</strong> &lt; 3.14286 )</p>

<p>Unfortunately for our man Archimedes, and later, for thousands of mathematicians who proceeded to calculate this fake <strong>Foo Pi</strong> value to increasing number of decimal places &hellip; this <strong>proof and subsequent conclusion</strong> are simply <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="where-was-the-error-you-may-ask">Where was the error, you may ask ?</h2>

<p>It was in the <strong>assumption</strong>.</p>

<p>And assumption, as it is often said, is the mother of all &hellip; (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ASSUMPTION">you probably know that one</a>).</p>

<h2 id="circle-with-two-6-sided-regular-polygons">Circle with two 6-sided regular polygons</h2>

<p>Let us look at it in some detail, starting with basic <strong>6-sided polygon</strong> (hexagon) in the picture.</p>

<p><img src="/images/6polyCircle.png" alt="Figure 2. Circle and 6-sided polygons" title="Circle with two 6-sided polygons" /></p>

<p>Please forgive the ridiculous coloring, it is just for better visibility.</p>

<p>There is red-painted hexagon outside, blue circle, and green hexagon inscribed inside the circle.
Note that we are measuring perimeters (length of lines and not surface area) of circle and polygons.</p>

<p>We have 6 equal segments, so everything we observe for one is valid for all of them.
Let us look closely at one of these segments.</p>

<p><img src="/images/6polySegment.png" alt="Figure 3. Single segment, 6-sided polygons" title="Single segment, 6-sided polygons" /></p>

<p>Assumption is:</p>

<p><strong>x</strong> &lt; <strong>a</strong> &lt; <strong>y</strong>   (for any value of <strong>n</strong>)</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>x</strong> - side length of inscribed polygon</li>
<li><strong>a</strong> - arc length of a single segment</li>
<li><strong>y</strong> - side length of circumscribed polygon</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> - number of sides of regular polygon (n-sided regular polygon)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>x &lt; a</strong> is always valid - due to the obvious fact that straight line between two points is always shorter than any curved line going through these same two points. Straight line is the shortest path.</p>

<p><strong>a &lt; y</strong> (for any value of <strong>n</strong>) is <strong>not always correct</strong>, and this is the part that fails.</p>

<p>This part has never been mathematically proven, nor is it at all obvious from the picture.</p>

<p><strong>a &lt; y</strong> is only valid for regular polygons with relatively small number of sides (more precisely, n &lt; 59). This may be the reason why it was overlooked in the first place, since it would take some skill to precisely create and measure polygons with larger number of sides.</p>

<p>As the <strong>n</strong> (number of sides) increases, <strong>y</strong> will tend to be closer and closer to <strong>x</strong> in length, and arc <strong>a</strong> will be longer than any of them by a small amount. Multiply that small amount by a number of sides <strong>n</strong>, and there you have the error.</p>

<p>If only our man Archimedes stopped at n = 48 , and did not do one more doubling of sides to reach n = 96 &hellip; he might had a correct conclusion, oh well.</p>

<h2 id="circle-with-two-96-sided-regular-polygons">Circle with two 96-sided regular polygons</h2>

<p>Let us look more closely at same setup, but now with <strong>96-sided polygons</strong> (same colors as above).</p>

<p><img src="/images/96polyCircle.png" alt="Figure 4. Circle and 96-sided polygons" title="Circle with two 96-sided polygons" /></p>

<p>What, you see only green circle with some blur on the edges ?</p>

<p>That is correct, the difference between circles and polygons is so small on this scale, that only only green inner polygon is seen, and it looks like a circle at low resolution. (Better resolution pictures available below.)</p>

<p>Now, let us enlarge one of these 96 segments, for your viewing pleasure:</p>

<p><img src="/images/96polySegment.png" alt="Figure 5. Single segment, 96-sided polygons" title="Single segment, 96-sided polygons" /></p>

<p>(For a better view, please open above image separately, by clicking <a href="/images/96polySegment.png" title="Single segment, 96-sided polygons">here</a> )</p>

<p>Question: which outline looks <strong>longest</strong> to you ?</p>

<p>If your answer was: arc of the blue circle looks longer than straight sides of either inner or outer polygon, you would indeed be correct.
It <strong>is</strong> longer.</p>

<p>And that is why Pi cannot be calculated correctly using this method.</p>

<p>And all subsequent methods of determining <strong>Foo Pi</strong>, come from the same wrong assumption.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is important to understand :</p>

<p><strong>Length of a <em>curved line</em> cannot be correctly calculated using small segments of <em>straight lines</em> (rectification of a curve), no matter how small these segments are.</strong>
<strong>Such method is only an approximation, and inherently contains an error.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately this imprecise methodology is not exclusive to this case, but is a standard method on how science calculates dimensions of objects - rectification of the curve, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral">Integral calculus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wait-i-need-to-check-these-drawings-for-myself">Wait, I need to check these drawings for myself !</h2>

<p>These figures can be easily created with any good drawing application that supports vector graphics, like <a href="https://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> (free, GPLv3 license).</p>

<p>For your entertainment, Inkscape SVG files are provided :</p>

<li><a href="images/96polyCircle.svg" title="Circle with two 96-sided polygons">96 sided polygon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You may open them in <a href="https://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, and zoom-in almost to the maximum, to see the details.</p>

<p>Be well.</p>
