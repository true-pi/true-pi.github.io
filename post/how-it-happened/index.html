Circle and 6-sided polygons</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Please forgive the ridiculous coloring, it is just for better visibility.</p><p>There is red-painted hexagon outside, blue circle, and green hexagon inscribed inside the circle.
Note that we are measuring perimeters (length of lines and not surface area) of circle and polygons.</p><p>We have 6 equal segments, so everything we observe for one is valid for all of them.
Let us look closely at one of these segments.</p><figure class="center mw6"><a href=/images/6polySegment.png><img src=/images/6polySegment.png alt="Single segment, 6-sided polygons"></a><figcaption><h4>Figure 3. Single segment, 6-sided polygons</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Assumption is:</p><p><strong>x</strong> &lt; <strong>a</strong> &lt; <strong>y</strong> (for any value of <strong>n</strong>)</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li><strong>x</strong> - side length of inscribed polygon</li><li><strong>a</strong> - arc length of a single segment</li><li><strong>y</strong> - side length of circumscribed polygon</li><li><strong>n</strong> - number of sides of regular polygon (n-sided regular polygon)</li></ul><p><strong>x &lt; a</strong> is always valid - due to the obvious fact that straight line between two points is always shorter than any curved line going through these same two points. Straight line is the shortest path.</p><p><strong>a &lt; y</strong> (for any value of <strong>n</strong>) is <strong>not always correct</strong>, and this is the part that fails.</p><p>This part has never been mathematically proven, nor is it at all obvious from the picture.</p><p><strong>a &lt; y</strong> is only valid for regular polygons with relatively small number of sides (more precisely, n &lt; 59). This may be the reason why it was overlooked in the first place, since it would take some skill to precisely create and measure polygons with larger number of sides.</p><p>As the <strong>n</strong> (number of sides) increases, <strong>y</strong> will tend to be closer and closer to <strong>x</strong> in length, and arc <strong>a</strong> will be longer than any of them by a small amount. Multiply that small amount by a number of sides <strong>n</strong>, and there you have the error.</p><p>If only our man Archimedes stopped at n = 48 &hellip; at least his conclusion would have been correct, oh well.</p><h2 id=circle-with-two-96-sided-regular-polygons>Circle with two 96-sided regular polygons</h2><p>Let us look more closely at same setup, but now with <strong>96-sided polygons</strong> (same colors as above).</p><figure class="center mw6"><a href=/images/96polyCircle.png><img src=/images/96polyCircle.png alt="Circle with two 96-sided polygons"></a><figcaption><h4>Figure 4. Circle and 96-sided polygons</h4></figcaption></figure><p>What, you see only green circle with some blur near the edge ?</p><p>That is correct, the difference between circles and polygons is so small on this scale, that only only green inner polygon is seen, and it looks like a circle at low resolution. (Better resolution pictures available below.)</p><p>Now, let us enlarge the edge of a single segment, for your viewing pleasure:</p><figure><a href=/images/96polySegment.png><img src=/images/96polySegment.png alt="Single segment, 96-sided polygons"></a><figcaption><h4>Figure 5. Single segment, 96-sided polygons</h4></figcaption></figure><p>(For a better view, please open above image separately, by clicking on it. )</p><p>Question: which outline looks <strong>longest</strong> to you ?</p><p>If your answer was: arc of the blue circle looks longer than straight sides of either inner or outer polygon, you would indeed be correct.
It <strong>is</strong> longer.</p><p>And that is why Pi cannot be calculated correctly using this method.</p><p>All subsequent methods of determining <strong>Foo Pi</strong>, come from the same wrong assumption.<br>They all attempt to calculate length of a curved line by approximating it with very large number of short straight lines (large <strong>n</strong>).</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This is important to understand :</p><p><strong>Length of a <em>curved line</em> cannot be correctly calculated using small segments of <em>straight lines</em> (rectification of a curve), no matter how small these segments are.</strong>
<strong>Such method is only an approximation, and inherently contains an error.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately this imprecise methodology is not exclusive to this case, but is a standard method on how science calculates dimensions of objects - rectification of the curve, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral>Integral calculus</a>.</p><p>It may not just be Pi that is wrong.</p><h2 id=wait-i-need-to-check-these-drawings-for-myself>Wait, I need to check these drawings for myself</h2><p>These figures can be easily created with any good drawing application that supports vector graphics, like <a href=https://www.inkscape.org>Inkscape</a> (free, GPLv3 license).</p><p>For your entertainment, Inkscape SVG files are provided :</p><ul><li><a href=/images/6polyCircle.svg title="Circle with two 6-sided polygons">6 sided polygon</a></li><li><a href=/images/96polyCircle.svg title="Circle with two 96-sided polygons">96 sided polygon</a></li></ul><p>You may open them in <a href=https://www.inkscape.org>Inkscape</a>, and zoom-in almost to the maximum, to see the details.</p><p>Be well.</p><ul class=pa0><li class=list><a href=/tags/archimedes class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Archimedes</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/foo-pi class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Foo Pi</a></li></ul><div class=mt6></div></section><aside class="w-25-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">What&#39;s in this post</p><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#where-was-the-error-you-may-ask>Where was the error, you may ask ?</a></li><li><a href=#circle-with-two-6-sided-regular-polygons>Circle with two 6-sided regular polygons</a></li><li><a href=#circle-with-two-96-sided-regular-polygons>Circle with two 96-sided regular polygons</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#wait-i-need-to-check-these-drawings-for-myself>Wait, I need to check these drawings for myself</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/post/true-pi-foo-pi/>True Pi vs. Foo Pi</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://true-pi.github.io>&copy; 2019 True Pi</a><div><a href=# class="link-transition twitter link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Back To Top" aria-label="Back to Top"><svg height="32" style="enable-background:new 0 0 12 6" viewBox="0 0 12 6" width="32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></a></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
