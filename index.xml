      <description>It all begins well over 2000 years ago (if you can believe history textbooks) in ancient Greece, with a man named Archimedes.
He devised a geometrical method of finding approximate value of Pi, by calculating perimeters of regular n-sided polygons.
The idea was basically this:
 put one n-sided polygon that just fits inside the circle (inscribed polygon), and put another polygon that circumscribes the circle (fits around it). The circumference of the circle will be somewhere between perimeter of inner and outer polygons.</description>

      <description>For some years now, I have been hearing that Pi ( Ï€ ) value in our textbooks is neither right nor correct.
There has been some anecdotal evidence from people manufacturing cylinders of larger diameter, saying that measured circumference is not the same as calculated one.
How did this error of Pi happen, how did it persist for over 2000 years, and still does persist in our textbooks today ?</description>
